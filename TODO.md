Some TODO items after creating this project. Can delete this file after completing them.

- Fill in project details in [README.rmd](README.rmd) and remember do knit your README using `devtools::build_readme()`.
- Read through the README files in each directory and edit as necessary.
- Add and commit all files under Git version control.
- Set up [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for reproducibility.
- Set up [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). If you want to be able to view `docs/` interactively, you will need to set up [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Remember to change the folder from which the Github Pages site is built to `docs/`. **WORD OF WARNING:** even if your repository is *private*, the interactive site will be *public*, so think twice about whether you want to do this at the beginning or end of a project.
- Edit [index.md](docs/index.md) to reflect analyses run.
